To use the program:
- In config, choose game and game settings.
- Models that are trained will only work with the settings they are trained for (e.g. board size for hex, move types for nim)
- TOPP loads models from Models/TOPP
- OHT loads model from Models/OHT
- Play needs model path specified
- Training will save at intervals specified in config to Models/ModelCache
- Conv network is specifically constructed for Hex, and probably will fail for other games
- Dense network should be general (need to add input sizes to list for each game)
- Playing, training, OHT, TOPP all need the models trained game settings to be set in config to run properly
    - Ex. Play against a 4x4 hex bot, set game to hex, board_size to 4 in config
